The "Chatroom" (unnoficially called CoderzConnect) is a program meant to allow people to communicate with each other. Users can conect to the server and login or create an account to use the service. This program is less of 'chatroom' and more of a messaging service as conversations persist after logging of. 

Users have the ability to create accounts and add friends by username. In order to add a friend, a user must send a friend request and wait for the recepient to accept the request. Once the request is accepted, both users can message each other. Conversations are automatically saved and can be viewed later.
